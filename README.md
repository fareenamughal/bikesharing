___

## Results
___

Tableau has been used to provide visualizations supporting the analysis. Visualizations are a powerful tool to say a story. The analysis shows that the optimal trip time is approximately 30 minutes, with the largest user group being those of subscribers and males followed by females. Males make up approximately 5/8th of the total whilst females make up a 1/4 and unknown gender approximately 1/8th of the total customers. The largest number of trips during the weekday occur between 5pm to 7pm and 5am to 8am, whilst during the weekend the trips are spread out between 10am to 7pm. The unknown gender customers exceed the male and female.

The pandas/python code written to convert the trip duration from integer to datetime and then generate the revised trip duration csv file can be found as per link below:

## Summary
___

The analysis indicates that the servicing of the bikes should bne carried out between midnight and 5am. The other subscribers i.e. female subscribers should be provided with some sort of encouragement or incentive to use bike share more often. It migh be worthwhile to generate ideas to attract female subscribers and users.
